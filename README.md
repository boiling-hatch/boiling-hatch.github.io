My twine story, The wives of Henry VIII, revolves around the wives of Henery. It focuses on the life, and the choices Henry made and the reasons for his actions. It has a mix of actual history, and counter factual history to make the game more engaging for the audience. It is to shed new perspective on if Henry made different decisions, how would the history of England be written. The story is meant to be a 1st person perspective as the player is playing Henry VIII. It is the for the audience to question his decisions, and see the outcome if Henry decided to make different decisions. I specifically made the decisions to make the audience question Henry's morality and also understand that history cannot be changed. So a lot the different decisions lead to Henry's demise and the destruction of his kingdom. I also wanted the player to fully understand the reasons for his actions, and understand the full history, in a condensed form, about his wives.
